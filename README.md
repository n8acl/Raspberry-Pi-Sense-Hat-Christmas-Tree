Just in time for Christmas, a Christmas tree with flashing colored decorations and a red star on top. The color and shape of the tree and the speed at which the colors change can be altered by changing the parameters at the top of the code. Directions are in the comments.

Revision 11/25/2018:
Discovered a bug that caused the tree to gradually turn brown. Fixed the problem but kept the behavior by creating a treeDies flag. Also responded to a request that the tree automatically go on and off on a schedule using the treeActive flag. State of the tree is saved before clearing the display, and restored when the tree restarts. Schedule for starting and stopping the tree are settable.
